IntelliJ IDEA Color Scheme
==========================

**Deep Water Coral** is a color scheme that I've created over time.

It started as a PHP,JavaScript,HTML and CSS dark color scheme.
The idea was to create a color scheme that is
dark, easy on the eyes, increases focus on important parts and vise versa.

In time it was finely grained into a polyglot color scheme.

Currently it fully supports:

- [PHP](../screenshots/PHP.png)
- [Java](../screenshots/Java.png)
- [JavaScript](../screenshots/JS.png)
- [HTML/XML](../screenshots/HTML.png)
- [CSS](../screenshots/CSS.png)
- [SQL](../screenshots/SQL.png)
- [Bash](../screenshots/Bash.png)
- [Lua](../screenshots/lua.png)
- [Python](../screenshots/Python.png)
- [ini](../screenshots/ini.png)
