IntelliJ IDEA Color Scheme
==========================

**Deep Water Coral** is a color scheme that I've created over time.

It started as a PHP,JavaScript,HTML and CSS dark color scheme.
The idea was to create a color scheme that is
dark, easy on the eyes, increases focus on important parts and vise versa.

In time it was finely grained into a polyglot color scheme.
