IntelliJ IDEA Color Scheme
==========================

**Deep Water Coral** is a color scheme that I've created over time.

It started as a PHP,JavaScript,HTML and CSS dark color scheme.
The idea was to create a color scheme that is
dark, easy on the eyes, increases focus on important parts and vise versa.

In time it was finely grained into a polyglot color scheme.

Currently it fully supports:

- Java
- PHP
- Javascript
- HTML/XML
- CSS
- SQL
- Bash
- Lua
- Python
- Regex
- ini
- properties
- git statuses


Installation
------------
Just download `colors.jar` file, then Run your IDE and import colorscheme settings from this file (`File` &rarr; `Import Settings...`)

Feedback appreciated.
